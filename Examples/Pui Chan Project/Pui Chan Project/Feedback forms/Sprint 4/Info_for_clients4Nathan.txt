Tsunami
This is the huge blue thing that is chasing you
For the first level, is the speed of the wave adequate?
I think for the first level the speed of the tsunami is fine. It's not too fast that it kills you instantly, and it's not too slow that it does not seem like a threat (but in later levels you may want to increase the speed).

Should there be events that change the behaviour of the wave?
I think there should be. There should be a trigger of somesort that increases the tsunami's speed, or in later levels decreases it.

Combat system
Player and enemies have 3 combat attributes: health, strength and defense
In combat, Health is the distance from the neutral point to the point where the player/enemy loses
Strength is the damage dealt per attack
Defense is the fraction of the opponent's attack the player/enemy resists

Would you stick with combat where the key to attack occasionally changes 
or would you prefer spamming one randomly selected key?
I am more of a fan of QTE's (quick time events); so I think it would be more interesting if a key prompt would appear somewhere (maybe the middle) of the screen telling you what button to press.

Should the enemy have a random chance of attacking, or should it attack constantly?
I think constant attack, but the damage is rng based. Depending on the strength/level of the enemy it does between 1-3 dmg (for example).


Level design
Should the platforms be closer to each other?
I think they are a nice distance from each other. I don't think they should be closer but try testing different measurements to see which one feels best.

Should the items, obstacles and enemies be randomly placed around the course?
Yes. I don't think they should be in one select location, I think it would be better if the items are randomly generated.
