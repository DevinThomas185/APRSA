Colour key:
- Yellow = Coin
- Cyan = Treasure
- Green = Bandages
- Grey = Barrel
- Black = Anchor
- Brown = Horses
- Orange = Rum
- Red = Med chest

Is the HUD organised enough so that it isn't an eyesore?
Which of the following information would you also need in game?
- Player progress bar          no, not currently, maybe later when there are alot of levels?
- Active effects list              yes, would be very useful.
- Speed                           could be useful to see until an animation for max speed has been added like in Terraria (if you are doing that, if not, a counter would be good)
- Player attributes              Are there going to be multiple characters to play as with different attributes? if not, probably not in game, just as lik extra info or something

Here is a list of all the items I currently plan to have in the game:
- Coins (+1 money, 10-40 points)
- Treasure Chest (+20 money, 50-100 points)
- Bandages (+1 heart, 0 points)
- Medicine Chest (Max health, 0 points)
- Bottle o Rum (+3 health, -3 max speed for 10s, 100-200 points)
- Horses (+5 max speed for 20s, 100-200 points)
- Cannon (To be implemented)
- Ship (To be implemented)
Is this enough, or would you suggest more items to be added?           enough for now, different areas different items?	
Are each item rewards adequate?                                               yes

Here is a list of all the effects from items and obstacles:
- Max speed up
- Max speed down
- Knock out
Would you suggest any more effects?                          dazed - caracter movement is random, up can make you go left, left could go right, that sort of thing

Here is a list of all the obstacles I currently plan to implement:
- Anchor (-1 heart, 6s knock out)
- Barrel (-1 heart, 3s knock out)
- Crate (-1 heart, 3s knock out)
Any more obstacles you would like added?		          A bomb- after a delay (fuse) an area around it would be destroyed
						          A trap, stand on it and get dazed
And are the penalties adequate?                                               Crate less knock out than barrel (2.5?), good otherwise
