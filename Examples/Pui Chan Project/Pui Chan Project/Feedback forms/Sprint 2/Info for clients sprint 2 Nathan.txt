Colour key:
- Yellow = Coin
- Cyan = Treasure
- Green = Bandages
- Grey = Barrel
- Black = Anchor
- Brown = Horses
- Orange = Rum
- Red = Med chest

Is the HUD organised enough so that it isn't an eyesore?
The HUD is fine, I don't see any neeed to change it beucase it's fine for now (when you start implimenting different features you may find a need to change it, or just want to).

Which of the following information would you also need in game?
- Player progress bar
- Active effects list
- Speed
- Player attributes

I believe that implimenting all of these onto the HUD somewhere could prove useful, because you are filling it up and leaving no blanks; also it helps the player gain a better understanding on how well they are currently doing within the game.

Here is a list of all the items I currently plan to have in the game:
- Coins (+1 money, 10-40 points)
- Treasure Chest (+20 money, 50-100 points)
- Bandages (+1 heart, 0 points)
- Medicine Chest (Max health, 0 points)
- Bottle o Rum (+3 health, -3 max speed for 10s, 100-200 points)
- Horses (+5 max speed for 20s, 100-200 points)
- Cannon (To be implemented)
- Ship (To be implemented)
Is this enough, or would you suggest more items to be added?
Are each item rewards adequate?

I think that for now the items are fine, but you may want to change the amount of coins you gain depending on how much items will cost within the shop.

Here is a list of all the effects from items and obstacles:
- Max speed up
- Max speed down
- Knock out
Would you suggest any more effects?

Maybe you could add some wacky/fun effects to make the game a bit more entertaing or challenging, for example add: An effect that increases/decrease your current gravity setting, or invert the controls, or even do something weird like changing the colours or art style (or you could make a seize mode where it has multi-colours flashing).

I dunno, just thinking of weird ideas you could impliment.

Here is a list of all the obstacles I currently plan to implement:
- Anchor (-1 heart, 6s knock out)
- Barrel (-1 heart, 3s knock out)
- Crate (-1 heart, 3s knock out)
Any more obstacles you would like added?
And are the penalties adequate?

I cannot currently think of any obstacles to add, but if I think of any soon I will tell you. And I think that at least one of the obstacles should do -2 health because if every object did -1 it would not really be challenging. Also you should have at least one object that insta-kills people to increase the difficulty.
