There are 4 GUI objects for the menus in the game:
-Buttons
-Sliders
-Tick boxes
-Drop down menus
Am I missing any others?

The menus can be navigated by mouse or keyboard. Use the arrow keys to move a black pointer
around the menu and press enter to activate the pointed GUI object.
How is the keyboard menu navigation? Is it obvious at where you are pointing at in the menu?
Is it easy to move around in the menu? Does it confuse you?

keyboard navigation is good and obvious. Its easy and not confusing

For sliders and drop down menus, the menu focuses on them when you select them with the enter
key. This allows you to move the slider left or right with the left and right keys, or search
through the options in the drop down menu using up and down keys. You then press enter again to
"defocus" or deactivate the slider or drop down menu so you can return to moving the pointer
around the menu again.
How easy to use is this? How is the slider speed? Any difficulties do you feel when using them?

easy to use, speed is a little slow. I will explain something when we next do projects in lesson
Any other things you'd like to point out?
