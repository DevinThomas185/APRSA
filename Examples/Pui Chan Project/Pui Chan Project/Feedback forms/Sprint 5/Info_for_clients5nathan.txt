There are 4 GUI objects for the menus in the game:
-Buttons
-Sliders
-Tick boxes
-Drop down menus
Am I missing any others?

The menus can be navigated by mouse or keyboard. Use the arrow keys to move a black pointer
around the menu and press enter to activate the pointed GUI object.
How is the keyboard menu navigation? Is it obvious at where you are pointing at in the menu?
I like the keyboard navigation, the little box next to the text makes it clear where you currently are, so you cannot get lost.

Is it easy to move around in the menu? Does it confuse you?
Menu is very simplistic, so it does not confuse me in the slightest

For sliders and drop down menus, the menu focuses on them when you select them with the enter
key. This allows you to move the slider left or right with the left and right keys, or search
through the options in the drop down menu using up and down keys. You then press enter again to
"defocus" or deactivate the slider or drop down menu so you can return to moving the pointer
around the menu again.
How easy to use is this? How is the slider speed? Any difficulties do you feel when using them?
I like the way it's set up (settings menu I am talking about). Sliders for sound, dropdown for difficulty, etc. 

Get rid of the yellow tho, it's really ugly.

Any other things you'd like to point out?
Aside from my hatred for the yellow on the settings tab, nothing. 

I think this was a very prodcutive build because of what you have implimented.
